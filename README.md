Newsfeed
========

Newsfeed is a Bukkit plugin that creates and instant website for your server.  Our goal is to create an informational website that keeps players in contact with the server, even when they are not playing.  Often, players just want to know what has been happening on the server without logging in.  Newsfeed gives your players a way to stay in touch with your server, keeping them 'in the know'.  Also, it gives the players a way to show off accomplishments they have made on the server.  Gamers love letting people know what they have been up to and chatting about it later.  The more players talk about the server, the more they'll play.  

Newsfeed even works on mobile devices!  Thank you [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)! 

To use Newsfeed, all you have to do is download the jar and follow the the simple instructions below.  For now, Newsfeed has a dependency on [McMMO](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mcmmo/).  Please have that installed.  After that, run your server and start playing.  At this point, everything is on autopilot from then on.  Don't worry about configurations, permissions, and commands.  To view your Newsfeed, just go to [http://localhost:1975/newsfeed](http://localhost:1975/newsfeed).  If you have a public server, make sure you open up port 1975 to the world.

I hope you guys enjoy Newsfeed as much as we have!
